Existing Features
Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is responsive on all four pages which are Logo,  Home  About, Team and Facilities. The navigation is also fixed to the whole page which allows easy navigation for the user without having to scroll up and down. 

The landing page image

The landing includes a photograph with text  to allow the user to know that it is a kindergarten website , whre its located and what ages are enrolled in the school. 
It has a background image of a teacher with a child. This is to make the page attractive, relevant and easy to understand before even reading the other  page contents.
This section introduces also has a Register button that opens in another page to allow the user to register their child easily. A liner gradient property was used to allow the user to see the text cleary as without it the image was to bright and making the text a little bit to bright to read.

Solved Problems



when on small screens the navigation bar was out of the blue backgound and on top of other page contents making it hard to read other contents so height was increased through meadia queries for small screens and added a lineheight of 10px on the  #nav_links, #logo

 when register button is put as a div which is sugested by the W3C validator it becomes a block element which fills out the whole line.



I could not push my project to git hub so used the following command and problem was solved git config pull.rebase true
